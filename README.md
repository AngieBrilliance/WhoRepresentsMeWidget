##About The Widget##
====================

  - The widget is an embeddable iFrame (built with Django) that would pull from the Sunlight Foundation's     [Congress](https://sunlightlabs.github.io/congress/) and [Open States](http://sunlightlabs.github.io/openstates-api/) APIs.
  - The first user would be able to embed this widget on a webpage. 
  - The second user would input their full address into the the landing page of the widget, and press submit to then retrieve the user's State Representatives, Federal Representatives, and Congressperson.
  - The second user's results would show in an easy to read, user friendly, card/list format. 
  - The user's representative results would be clickable. When a representative is clicked an option to email, tweet, or call, would show, as well as an option to redirect to the representative's sunlight homepage.
